### Introduction
This repository contains the Verilog code for an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Master Controller developed by Team VLSI Vanguard. The SPI Master Controller facilitates communication between a microcontroller (master) and multiple peripheral devices (slaves) in a serial synchronous manner. SPI is a popular communication protocol used for interfacing various peripherals such as sensors, displays, and memory devices in embedded systems.

### SPI Protocol Details
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol is a synchronous serial communication interface that allows full-duplex communication between a master device and one or more slave devices. The SPI protocol typically uses four signals:
- **MOSI (Master Out Slave In):** Data line for transmitting data from the master to the slave.
- **MISO (Master In Slave Out):** Data line for transmitting data from the slave to the master.
- **SCLK (Serial Clock):** Clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transmission.
- **CS (Chip Select):** Control signal used by the master to select a specific slave device for communication.

### Modules
- **`spi_state`:** This module implements the SPI Master Controller functionality. It includes state machines to manage SPI communication, shift registers for data transmission, and control logic for generating SPI clock and chip select signals.
  
- **`tb`:** The testbench module is used to simulate the behavior of the `spi_state` module. It provides stimulus to the `spi_state` module and verifies its functionality.

### Testbench
The testbench (`tb`) module provides stimulus to the `spi_state` module by simulating clock signals, resets, and data inputs. It verifies the functionality of the SPI Master Controller under different scenarios.

### Team Collaboration
This project was collaboratively developed by Team VLSI Vanguard. Each team member contributed to different aspects of the project, including design, implementation, testing, and documentation. The teamwork and coordination among team members were essential for the successful completion of the project.
